Repo for project Rusty Rhino

<b>Elevator pitch:</b>
On average people can get hundreds of irrelevant emails a week. These could range from innocent but annoying chain mails to extremely harmful viruses and phishing attacks. InboxLock allows users to connect their email and quickly filter new emails by allowing, deleting or blocking emails and senders that are potentially dangerous.
